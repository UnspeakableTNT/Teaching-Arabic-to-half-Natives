# Teaching-Arabic-to-half-Natives
This is a remade repository of my old 2023 project, made to help teach half Natives (people who's parents where immigrants to another country, so those individuals learned some phrases and mostly how to speak Arabic but never understood  how to write it and read it), this website uses voices, and words to help grow their Arabic.
